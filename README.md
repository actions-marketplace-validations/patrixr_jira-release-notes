# Jira Release Notes

This action generates release notes based on JIRA ticket numbers found in commits, and creates a PDF file. It can also email you the notes.

Built as part of the [#ActionsHackathon](https://dev.to/devteam/announcing-the-github-actions-hackathon-on-dev-3ljn)

# How it works

You need to provide 2 refs to the action, `head` and `base`. The action steps are as followed:

1. Fetch all the commits between the `head` and `base` refs
2. Find any reference to JIRA ticket numbers, based on the `jira-code` you provide
3. Will fetch the ticket titles using the `jira-host`, `jira-username` and `jira-password` you provide
4. If `pdf` is set to true:
   4.1. Will generate a pdf with the list of changed tickets, and output the file path under the `pdf` variable
otherwise
   4.2. Will generate markdown with the list of changed tickets, and output it under the `markdown` variable
6. (OPTIONAL) If the `email-to` and `sendgrid-api-key` are provided, and email will be sent with the notes

## Credentials: Passwords vs API Tokens

JIRA supports authentication via username password. However as an alternative to using your password it is possible to substitute it with an API Token.

## Intended usage

This action can compare any 2 refs (head and base). For example you could compare 2 branches together.

But the action was designed to work with github pull requests.

For example, when merging into your 'live' branch, you can push out emails to the team.

Github actions, when triggered on pull requests, provide the two SHAs needed to make the comparison:

- `github.event.pull_request.head.sha`
- `github.event.pull_request.base.sha`

You can find an example below on how to use those.
